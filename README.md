# iSip

 iSip is a mobile application that allows users to search through various coffees that they can add to an order.
Once the user has completed their desired order, they can navigate to the order tab to place their order.
Users are met with a final view where they can determine their method of payment and decide if they would like to leave
a tip.

Assuming you have Xcode the project is fully functional and ready to download. If you do not have the proper operating
software you will need to download Xcode for an in depth view.
